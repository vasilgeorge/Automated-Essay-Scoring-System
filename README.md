## Deep Learning combined with Topic Modeling for Automated Essay Scoring

In this repo is included an Automated Essay Scoring System based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). The whole network was trained on the AWA (Analytical Writing Assessment) GMAT essays datasets, that consisted of *~730,000* essays achieving a top-1 accuracy of **82.4%**.

A visualization technique is also included that visualizes the features that the network exctracts, based on which it assigns the final scores to the essays.
